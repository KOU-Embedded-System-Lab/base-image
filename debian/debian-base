# To disable apt recommends & suggests:

# You can configure apt via apt.conf files.
# Here is a command I use on my server (as root):

cat > /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01norecommend << EOF
APT::Install-Recommends "0";
APT::Install-Suggests "0";
EOF

# To see if apt reads this, enter this in command line (as root or regular user):

apt-config dump | grep Recommends

# 2nd way (as root):

nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10norecommends

# Add this two lines:
#APT::Install-Recommends "0";
#APT::Install-Suggests "0";

# /etc/apt/sources.list
# If you also want the contrib and non-free components, add contrib non-free
# after main.

# Install needed packages:
sudo apt-get install xorg xfce4 xfce4-goodies bash-completion
